## Description


Whatever the project, the mode of recording and displaying the year names generally starts from the widest chronological range and goes to the narrowest. The following hierarchy is thus almost always found: period / dynasty / ruler / year name / month / day.  This is the system adopted for example by ORACC and CDLI; it is difficult to get rid of it.


## Recommended fields
Period
Ruler or eponym
Year
Month
Day

## Optional fields
Dynasty
Year name

## Resources

### Periods
See <chronology_period.html>

### Dynasty

### Ruler

### Eponym

### Month

### Year names
See the very simple presentation mode adopted by cdli:wiki:

To search for a date, the most explicit model is given by the ad hoc window on the website of the Archibab project:
