## Description


Whatever the project, the mode of recording and displaying the date generally starts from the widest chronological range and goes to the narrowest. The following hierarchy is thus almost always found: period / dynasty / ruler / year name / month / day.  This is the system adopted for example by ORACC and CDLI and with some variations in some projects.


## Recommended fields
Period
Ruler or eponym
Year
Month
Day

## Optional fields
