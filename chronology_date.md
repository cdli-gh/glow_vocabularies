## Description
A date is a temporal entity which can be approximate or not and uncertain or not, this both based on information known from the artifact to which it is associated (though information found in the text, archaeological find context, and palaeographic and artifact typology infomation) and based on our general understanding of the time frame in which the specific date occurs.   
  
A date starts with providing the widest chronological range and goes to the narrowest, from the [period](chronology_period.html) to the day. The different information composing a date will varry according to project and the corpus that is being studied as dates were recorded differently in various places and times. 

## Recommended fields
Each field of this entity can be considered as a separate entity. However, for the sake of simplicity and compatibility among projects, they are treated here as parts of a single entity. Each project treats and encodes parts of a date differently in terms of format and structure but the idea remains the same and is grounded in decades of Assyriological practice. The first part of a date is the [period](chronology_period.html) which is discussed in a separate [document](chronology_period.html). A date cannot be dissociated of it's period, especially when some fields of the date entity are missing. See [period](chronology_period.html).

## Year
When known, the actual calendar year should be given. This year number is based on numerous sources specific to the period, culture and the thourough analysis of corpora for political, astronomical and environmental clues.

## Ruler
The ruler field refers to the regional ruler's name. The ruler's name can be mentioned in the text or can be deduced from the [year name](chronology_year_name.html) or the [eponym](#eponym) name.

## Regnal Year
Just like the ruler's name, the regnal year can be mentioned in the text or can be deduced from the [year name](chronology_year_name.html) or the [eponym](#eponym) name.

## Month
This field contains the month number of in the calendar. 

## Day
This field contains the number of the day in the current month.

## Optional fields
Optional fields should be used as possible when the date is uncertain. They will provide important information that helps narrowing down the date or date range associated with a text.

### Dynasty
This field should he used especially when the ruler's name is not available.

### Year name
This field should be used when the date number is not identifyable. See the [year name](chronology_year_name.html) page.

### Eponym
Providing the eponym name provides information towards regnal year.

### Month name
Especially in the third millennium, calendars can display variation and the calendrical position of a month in a city is not always certain.

## Resources
There are generally few digital resources listing vocabularies to use in the fields of the date entity. Aside from exracting lists of entities from digital corpora of existing projects, some lists are available at cdli::wiki and at cdli.
