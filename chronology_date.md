## Description

  
Whatever the project, the mode of recording and displaying the date generally starts from the widest chronological range and goes to the narrowest. The following hierarchy is thus almost always found: period / dynasty / ruler / year name / month / day.  This is the system adopted for example by ORACC and CDLI and with some variations in some projects.


## Recommended fields
### Period
Unless the 

Ruler or eponym
Year
Month
Day
A date cannot be dissociated of it's period, especially when some fields of the date entity are missing. See <chronology_period.html>

## Optional fields
### Dynasty

### Year name


## Resources
There are generally few digital resources listing vocabularies to use in the fields of the date entity. Aside from exracting lists of entities from digital corpora of existing projects, some lists are available at cdli::wiki and at cdli.
