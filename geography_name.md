## Description
The **name** entity defines _the lexical version of any accepted geographical proper noun_. A **name** will typically be associated with a [place](./geography_place.md), which may in turn be associated with a [location](./geography_location.md).

This entity largely follows the formal outline of the [name](https://pleiades.stoa.org/help/conceptual-overview) entity type employed by the [Pleiades: A Gazetteer of Past Places](pleiades.stoa.org) repository. Note that this includes historical as well as modern names.

The stable URI format for **name** records in Pleiades are described in more detail in the [Pleiades documentation](https://pleiades.stoa.org/help/what-are-pleiades-uris). Here, **name** URIs are subordinated to a single parent **place** record.

In the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) ontology, a **name** may be an instance of [Q82799 name](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82799), or a subordinate name with language specification, e.g. [Q624240 Arabic name](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q624240).
