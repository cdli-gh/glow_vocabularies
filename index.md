# Introduction
The Vocabularies Consortium (VoCo) is a loose network dedicated to further the standardisation of metadata entities and associated vocabularies in cuneiform studies. This initiative draws on the [Metadata in Assyriology](https://www.lingfil.uu.se/research/assyriology/events#MetadatainAssyriology) sessions organised by [Geomapping Landscapes of Writing: Large-Scale Spatial Analysis of the Cuneiform Corpus (GLoW)](https://www.lingfil.uu.se/research/assyriology/glow/) and held virtually at Uppsala University 23-26 November 2020, as well as a subsequent survey of data repositories and data standards in the field of cuneiform studies conducted during March and April 2021 (Rattenborg, Pag√©-Perron and Anderson, in preparation).

## Aims
Meetings of individual working groups of the Vocabularies Consortium were held in November of 2021 and March and April 2022. The consortium has primarily focused on primary contextual metadata, and here especially the formal definition of basic data entities and their associated vocabularies. So far, working groups within the consortium have been formed with reference to three general types of metadata:

* [Geography](./geography.md)
* [Chronology](./chronology.md)
* [Bibliography](./bibliography.md)

## Activities

Activities of this network have focused on surveying, developing, and guiding the joint formation and integration of key groups of metadata across different projects and repositories. Discussions and data collection efforts have been held with reference to three general working groups, each overseen by a convenor charged with practical matters of organising and documenting initiative activities. The primary requirement for individual participants has been their association with a project, initiative, or repository assembling and curating metadata vocabularies of the types mentioned above.
