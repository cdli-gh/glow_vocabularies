## Description
The **collection** entity defines _any public or private collection of cultural artefacts_. A **collection** record may refer to large public or private institutions or the collections of a single individual. A **collection** may refer to an extant collection, as well as any extinct or now dispersed collection that can be defined with a reasonable degree of certainty.

A collection predominantly refers to a discrete institution, for example a public or private museum or collection, the study collection of a university, college, or research institute, or the private collection or possessions of an individual. A collection can include anything from many tens of thousands of inscribed objects (e.g. the British Museum) or a single inscribed object in the possession of a known or anonymous individual.

Collection records held by the [Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de) have been added continuosly since the formation of the catalogue in 2003. The original form of collection records, still in widespread use in other databases, consisted of a single character string with the following format: **'[collection name]'**, with association certainty indicated by the absence (certain) or presence (uncertain) of a question mark **'?'** apended to the string.
