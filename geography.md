# Geography

## Aims
The documentation available from the Geography Working Group of the Vocabularies Consortium is intended as a set of minimum best practice guidelines for structuring data pertaining to geographical metadata in cuneiform studies research.

This documentation is intended as a resource for structuring and linking data collections to external resources through the definition of basic entities relating to geographical knowledge. The documentation is _not_ an outline of a comprehensive data structure, but rather an outline of the basic elements necessary for properly mapping geographical data contained in a research data collection to external identifiers currently in use within the disciplinary domain of cuneiform studies. While the authors encourage data sharing and reuse, the guidelines provided here does not entail sharing of research data, but serves to aid the alignment of data entities within a given research data collection to primary data ontologies for historical geography currently in use.

Each document provides first a **description** of the relevant data entity, followed by a section describing **recommended fields** to be included in a data table of the relevant data entity. We also include a section on **optional fields** with information on additional external identifiers that can be included. A section on **resources** provide basic details and links to online resources that may be consulted. The geographical data entities described in the documentation presented here include, at present, the following:

* [Place](./geography_place.md)
* [Name](./geography_name.md)
* [Location](./geography_location.md)
* [Region](./geography_region.md)
* [Collection](./geography_region.md)
