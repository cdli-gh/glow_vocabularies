# Geography
<p><font size=2>Geography Working Group</font><br><font size=1>Rune Rattenborg, Sebastian Borkowski, Manuel Molina, Jamie Novotny, Susanne Rutishauser</font></p>

## Aims
The documentation available from the Geography Working Group of the [Vocabularies Consortium](./index.md) is comprised by a list of [resources](#resources) and a set of basic [entitity record descriptions](#entitity-descriptions). The listed [resources](#resources) include databases and open access authority lists for a variety of spatial entities of relevance for cuneiform studies, which we recommend considering when linking data collections to external identifiers. The [entity descriptions](#entitity-descriptions) are intended as minimum best practice guidelines for structuring and linking metadata collections pertaining to geographical knowledge in digital text catalogues. Aligning and linking project data to external reference indices will significantly improve data interoperability, discoverability, and reuse. While we encourage the unrestricted access to research data, the guidelines provided here do not entail sharing of research data.

For inquiries, comments, and suggestions for improvement, please contact working group convenor Rune Rattenborg ([rune.rattenborg@lingfil.uu.se](rune.rattenborg@lingfil.uu.se)).

## Entitity descriptions

Entity descriptions provided in the pages listed below maintain the same structure. First a **description** of the relevant data entity, followed by a section describing **recommended fields** to be included in a data table of the relevant data entity. We also include a section on **optional fields** with information on additional external identifiers that can be included. A section on **resources** provide basic details and links to online resources that may be consulted.
