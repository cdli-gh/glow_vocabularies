## Aims
The documentation available from the Chronology Working Group of the [Vocabularies Consortium](index.html) is intended as a set of minimum best practice guidelines for structuring and linking metadata collections pertaining to chronological knowledge in cuneiform studies. Documentation provided below for individual data entities offers guidance on the alignment and linking of relevant metadata records to external reference indices in order to improve data interoperability, discoverability, and reuse. While we encourage the unrestricted access to research data, the guidelines provided here do not entail sharing of research data. Rather, it is meant to further mapping and linking to relevant open access reference indices, so as to improve compatibility of data collections and avoid data duplication through increased discoverability.

Entity documentation in the pages listed below maintain a similar structure. First a **description** of the relevant data entity, followed by a section describing **recommended fields** to be included in a data table of the relevant data entity. We also include a section on **optional fields** with information on additional external identifiers that can be included. A section on **resources** provide basic details and links to online resources that may be consulted. The geographical data entities described in the documentation presented here include, at present, the following:

* [Period](chronology_period.html)
* [Year name](chronology_year_name.html)   
* [Date](chronology_date.html)
