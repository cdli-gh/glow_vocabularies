## Description
The **publication** entity defines the features of any publication of a cuneiform artifact, which may act as a type of primary source publication. Secondary source references to cuneiform tablets, such as sign readings, translations, etc. will be dealt with in the Bibliography Reference Markdown. As included in digital catalogues in cuneiform studies, the publications feature consists of a standardized citation which typically includes: author, title, date, and other publication information for an artifact with a cuneiform inscription. For an example of these standardized citations found in bibliography **publication** entities as employed in digital catalogues in cuneiform studies, see the [CDLI](https://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/abbreviations_for_assyriology) and the [Keilschrift Bibliographie](https://vergil.uni-tuebingen.de/keibi/index.php?r=volume/list). 

## Recommended fields
As a **publication** may contain multiple entity types, we utilize the fields from [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#terms-bibliographicCitation) and [MARC](https://www.loc.gov/marc/umb/um01to06.html) standards. A **publication** should always include an **author** of the work, along with a **title** and **year** in which the work was published.
