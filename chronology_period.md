## Description
A period entity includes a conceptual definition of a relatively well-defined cultural or historical complex with an approximate chronological timespan and an approximate geographical extent.   
  
A period is a conceptual entity associating a relatively well-defined cultural or historical complex with an approximate chronological timespan and an approximate geographical extent. The name of the cultural or historical complex is typically derived from specialist nomenclature in fields such as philology, archaeology, or history, the temporal duration of which can be defined approximately defined as spanning one to several centuries, sometimes also millennia. Since a period is typically defined with reference to a specific cultural complex, it also implies a finite geographical extent, typically including a relatively well-established, if geographically fuzzy historical region. As such, a period constitutes an easy means for the approximate chronological and geographical location of an object or an event. The more accurate definition of this location, however, is dependent to a large extent on the intellectual premises that underlie the definition of the period in spatial and temporal terms, namely according to what criteria the chronological timespan and the geographical extent are defined.

## Resources
There are several digital indices available already that should be used or augmented rather than relying on print resources. For periods used for cuneiform inscriptions and related artefacts in the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus and others, see:

- https://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=adopted_periodisation_in_cdli
- https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/periods
  
For archaeological and historical periods relating to the Middle East more generally, see:

Note, however, that this resource do not currently include much in the way of up-to-date period sets for the cuneiform world.
